## Setup Instructions

To run these projects locally (e.g., Jupyter notebooks or the Flask app for "Binary Prediction with a Rainfall"), follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SajjadKhanYousafzai/Projects--Kaggle-.git
cd Projects--Kaggle-
2. Set Up the Environment:
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
