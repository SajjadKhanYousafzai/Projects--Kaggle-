Setup Instructions
To run these projects locally (e.g., Jupyter notebooks or the Flask app for "Binary Prediction with a Rainfall"), follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/SajjadKhanYousafzai/Projects--Kaggle-.git
cd Projects--Kaggle-


Set Up the Environment:

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
Create and activate a virtual environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Create a requirements.txt with:pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
catboost
xgboost
lightgbm
flask
seaborn
matplotlib
nltk
spacy
prophet
rdkit




Run Jupyter Notebooks:

Start Jupyter:jupyter notebook


Open the relevant notebook (e.g., in the project folder).


Run the Flask App (Binary Prediction with a Rainfall):

Navigate to the project folder:cd Binary\ Prediction\ with\ a\ Rainfall


Ensure catboost_model.pkl, scaler.pkl, and data/test.csv are present.
Run the Flask app:python app.py


Access at http://127.0.0.1:5000 to download predictions as a CSV file.


Data Files:

Place required datasets (e.g., train.csv, test.csv) in the respective project folders, typically under a data/ directory.
Download datasets from Kaggle if not included, adhering to Kaggle's data-sharing rules [].
