Diabetes Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on Diabetes Classification and includes a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify diabetes cases and segment customers based on behavioral and demographic data for targeted marketing or healthcare insights. The project leverages Python notebooks, machine learning models, and web applications for visualization and deployment.
Project Structure
The directory is organized as follows:

Diabetes_Classification/ (Root directory)
dataset/: Contains the raw data files (e.g., marketing_campaign.csv for customer segmentation or diabetes dataset).
models/: Stores trained machine learning models or scripts for model training.
plots/: Contains generated visualization files (e.g., PNGs, HTML files from Plotly).
templates/: HTML templates for web applications (if applicable).
Diabetes.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for diabetes classification analysis.
Customer_Segmentation_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for customer segmentation analysis (enhanced version provided earlier).
flask_app.py: Python script for a Flask web application to serve predictions or visualizations.
stapp.py: Python script for a Streamlit application to provide an interactive interface.
README.md: This file, providing project documentation.



Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd Diabetes_Classification


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install the following manually:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly scikit-learn yellowbrick scipy flask streamlit


Place the dataset file (e.g., marketing_campaign.csv) in the dataset/ directory.


Usage
Running the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook


Open Diabetes.ipynb or Customer_Segmentation_Notebook.ipynb to explore the analysis.
Run all cells to reproduce the results, including data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and visualizations.

Running the Web Applications

Flask Application:

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Flask app:python flask_app.py


Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the application.


Streamlit Application:

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run stapp.py


Open a browser and go to the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) to interact with the interface.



Generating Plots

Plots are automatically generated when running the notebooks and saved in the plots/ directory.
Use the interactive Plotly charts directly in the notebook or export them as HTML files.

Features

Diabetes Classification: Machine learning models to predict diabetes cases (details in Diabetes.ipynb).
Customer Segmentation: Unsupervised clustering (e.g., PCA and Agglomerative Clustering) to identify customer segments (details in Customer_Segmentation_Notebook.ipynb).
Web Deployment: Flask and Streamlit apps for sharing insights with stakeholders.
