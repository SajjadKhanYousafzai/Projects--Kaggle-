        <h2 class="h4 text-success">üçÑ Mushroom Classification Project</h2>
        <p>This application uses machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. The models were trained on a dataset of mushroom samples with various features including cap diameter, stem dimensions, colors, and seasonal information.</p>
        
        <h3 class="h5 text-success mt-4">üìä Dataset</h3>
        <p>The dataset contains information about various mushroom species, labeled as either edible (1) or poisonous (0). The features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cap diameter</strong>: Size of the mushroom cap in centimeters</li>
            <li><strong>Cap shape</strong>: Shape classification of the mushroom cap</li>
            <li><strong>Gill attachment</strong>: How the gills are attached to the stem</li>
            <li><strong>Gill color</strong>: Color of the gills under the cap</li>
            <li><strong>Stem height</strong>: Height of the mushroom stem in centimeters</li>
            <li><strong>Stem width</strong>: Width of the mushroom stem in centimeters</li>
            <li><strong>Stem color</strong>: Color of the mushroom stem</li>
            <li><strong>Season</strong>: Season when the mushroom typically grows</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="h5 text-success mt-4">ü§ñ Machine Learning Models</h3>
        <p>Several classification models were trained and evaluated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Random Forest</strong>: Best performing model with excellent accuracy</li>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: Simple yet effective baseline model</li>
            <li><strong>Gradient Boosting</strong>: Advanced ensemble learning method</li>
            <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors</strong>: Instance-based learning algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="h5 text-success mt-4">‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer</h3>
        <p class="alert alert-warning">This application is for educational purposes only. Never consume wild mushrooms based solely on this classification. Always consult with a mushroom expert or mycologist for proper identification before consuming any wild mushrooms. Misidentification can lead to serious illness or death.</p>
